Article I is the longest in the Constitution, suggesting the importance of Congress and the legislative power to the constitutional arrangement of American government. Indeed, the idea of “legislative supremacy” has long been a part of Anglo-American political theory.  The key to understanding the structure of the Constitution is recognizing that Congress is primarily a lawmaking body that must act consistently with the broad powers it has been given. The legislative power, while broad, is separate and distinct from the executive and judicial powers. The experience of America’s earliest constitutions show that the lawmaking function of legislatures can be performed more effectively when the other powers of government are placed in separate hands.  Under the Constitution, the United States Congress is bicameral, meaning it is made up of two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate has 100 members, two from every state, and the House is made up of 435 members, apportioned to the several states according to their population.

In Federalist No. 39, James Madison describes a republic as “... a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior.”  Republic arrangements, the Framers believed, offered certain benefits over pure democracies. In the first place, choosing representatives meant that the resulting assembly of law-givers would be smaller. Simply limiting the size of legislative bodies, they believed, would of itself improve deliberation. James Madison explained in Federalist No. 55: “In all very numerous assemblies, of whatever character composed, passion never fails to wrest scepter from reason. Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.” Pure democracies tend to act on passion rather than reason, and that is the case no matter how wise or virtuous the citizens tend to be.

The act of electing representatives enables the citizenry to choose the ablest among them to serve in the law-making capacity. James Madison explained that this “refinement” of public opinions allows voters to select “... a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial consideration” (Federalist No. 10). Legislative power in a republic is thus derived entirely from the people, but it reflects the best aspects of the people.  Finally, as Madison pointed out in Federalist No. 10, only in a representative democracy is it possible to have a popular form of government over an extended sphere. Pure democracies must be small to enable all citizens to gather in one place. If the law-givers are representatives of the people, however, then a popular form of government is possible over a territory as large as the United States. Because a large territory comprehends a “multiplicity of interests” (Federalist No. 51), unjust interests (or factions) are unlikely to gain a majority. Large republics will therefore be more temperate and less tumultuous than small democracies.

The Continental Congress met twice before the Articles of Confederation formally established the Confederation Congress.  The Confederation Congress was, in some respects, a more powerful actor than the Congress we know today under the Constitution. Under the Articles, Congress exercised plenary control over all governmental matters, including the selection of executive and judicial officers. In practice, however, since the Articles vested almost all executive and judicial powers in the states rather than the federal government, the Articles government was notably weak because it lacked the necessary authority to enforce the laws passed by Congress. By contrast, under the Constitution, Congress is generally limited to exercising legislative power with respect to issues of federal concern, though it is a much more powerful body than its predecessor.  Congress retains some non-legislative powers, such as the power to impeach and the duty to advise and consent on the appointment of certain federal officers.

Madison also wanted members of the House to have shorter terms than senators, in order to bind them more closely to the will of the people, yet he wanted their terms to be longer than what was common at the time. Many states had regarded one-year terms as the maximum length the people’s representatives could be trusted to serve. Many of the delegates, like Elbridge Gerry, “considered annual elections as the only defence of the people against tyranny” (June 12).

In Britain, the Lower House was structured so that it was more directly tied to the rights and interests of the people. Since taxation was considered a greater burden on the common man than the wealthy nobility, it was believed that only the people’s representatives could be trusted with decisions to raise revenue.

As the Senate would be generally a more capable set of men, it would be wrong to disable them from” originating revenue bills (June 13).  Ultimately, this provision was included in the United States Constitution more likely due to immediate jealousies than due to any slavish devotion to the precedent set by Britain. Many of the larger states were incensed that the small states were insisting on an equal vote in the Senate. As a compromise, the small states offered to withhold the important power of originating revenue bills from the Senate where they would have a disproportionate share of power. Madison, who was adamantly opposed to an equality of votes in the Senate, nonetheless wished to strike the provision excluding senators from originating revenue bills. Other members of the large states, however, saw it as a necessary concession to an equality in the Senate. While the Senate cannot originate revenue bills, it retains the power of amending revenue bills that originate in the House.

Some consider the Senate to be superior to the House and worthy of more respect or prestige. This notion may stem from the Senate’s small size, how it was originally chosen, and some of the special powers it exercises. Senators were originally chosen by state legislatures as opposed to being elected directly by the people, suggesting that senators represent states rather than the people directly, and arguably ensured that senators would posses greater reputation and stature in their states. Similarly, six-year terms suggest additional distance from the people, allowing for a greater detachment from the variable political winds of any particular issue. This distance and detachment in theory allows senators to determine the best course of action with respect to the country’s business without being consumed with the immediate demands of re-election.  Like the House of Representatives, the Senate has a few specific powers and responsibilities. The Senate must advise and consent with respect to the president’s nominees to governmental positions, including Supreme Court justices and cabinet-level secretaries. The idea of “advise and consent” has evolved into the present practice of confirmation hearings to consider nominees. In recent years these hearings have at times been quite contentious and have served to focus media attention on the Senate’s proceedings in confirming federal judges. After the House impeaches federal officials, the Senate tries impeachments, determining whether the impeached officer is convicted or acquitted.

The British example (as well as the theories expounded by Enlightenment philosophers such as Locke and Montesquieu) presupposed the ancient conception of the mixed regime, a blending of democratic, aristocratic, and monarchical features. Therefore, the legislative power was divided between an upper house dominated by the rich and well born (the House of Lords) and a lower house controlled by the people (the House of Commons). Dividing the legislature in this way reinforced the advantages of a mixed regime: it gave to every special interest in society some portion of power in order to protect itself from other interests.  America, though, was a country that boasted greater equality of condition than any other in history, so the class-based structure of Parliament did not make much sense in the United States. As Tocqueville would later observe, America had been a democratic land even before it was a country. Consequently, all power—whether legislative, executive, or judicial—would have to be derived from the people. But the Framers could nonetheless see that the various mechanisms for dividing power into separate distinct hands remained a prudent safeguard for the people’s rights. They would therefore have to find a way to do what the British had done without relying on the mechanism of the mixed regime—divisions between the people, the nobility, and the monarchy—to reinforce the separation of power.

Even if the Senate did not always act with greater wisdom and maturity than the House, it was still considered beneficial to subject each piece of legislation to a double-review process. Passing each piece of legislation through two bodies slows the legislative process, making it more deliberative. Alexis de Tocqueville, during his travels through America in the 1830s, commented that, while the U.S. Senate and House were truly distinct bodies with their own characteristics, the separate chambers of the state legislatures were usually indistinguishable from one another. Nonetheless, he praised Americans for their wisdom in maintaining the bicameral legislature:  “In dividing the legislative body into two branches, the Americans had no intention to create one hereditary assembly and another elected one; they did not mean to make the one an aristocratic body and the other a representative of democracy... To divide the legislative power and thus to slow down the movement of the political assemblies and create an appeal tribunal for the revision of laws were the only advantages resulting from... its two chambers. Time and experience have convinced the Americans that although these are its only two advantages, the division of legislative powers is yet a necessity of the first order.”  Today one often hears complaints about “gridlock” in the legislature. The Founders, however, were intentionally seeking ways to slow down the often rash and precipitate legislative process, a process which frequently resulted in voluminous, inconsistent, and ill-judged laws.

But all states under the Articles of Confederation, regardless of size, had enjoyed an equal vote in Congress. When framing the new Constitution, the less populous states refused to agree to any plan that would deprive them of an equality of votes in both houses. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut said he “was not sorry” to see representation in the lower house proportioned to population, especially since he “hoped it would become a ground of compromise with regard to the second branch.” He didn’t think that any Northeastern state other than Massachusetts “would listen to a proposition for excluding the states... from an equal voice in both branches” (June 29).

First, the large states had already agreed to an entirely equal voice in Congress under the old Confederation. Now that they were assembled to revise the Articles, Ellsworth asked if the large states “meant to pay no regard to this antecedent plighted faith” (June 29). Second, the defenders of the small states insisted that all states would still retain part of their sovereignty—the compact they were forming was “partly federal”—and therefore the states should be given protection for their interests they retained as states. William Paterson of New Jersey argued that the large states’ wishes of having proportional representation in both houses would be proper only:  “when state distinctions are done away; but those to certain purposes still exist. Will the government of Pennsylvania admit a participation of their common stock of land to the citizens of New Jersey? I fancy not. If therefore follows, that a national government, up the present plan [of proportional representation in both houses], is unjust, and destructive of the common principles of reciprocity.” (June 16, in Yates’ notes)  So long as individual states had interests distinct from other states, they should be given power to protect those interests.

He was destined to meet with more than one disappointment in the formation of the Senate.  The Virginia Plan also proposed that senators be nominated by the individual state legislatures and then elected by the House of Representatives. Madison was especially anxious to free all political actors at the federal level from the control of state legislatures. For that reason he also wanted to give them long terms, in order to provide additional stability and independence to that body. He thought a seven-year term for the Senate “by no means too long” (June 12), and, indeed, “did not conceive that the term of nine years could threaten any real danger” (June 26).

The clause arguably is consistent with the stance that Congress has broad power to act within those powers expressly delegated to it, and it has no power to act regarding powers not delegated to it.  Additionally, though congressional power is limited, it is broad. Congressional power extends to matters that are the domain of the federal government.

In the face of Antifederalist opposition, Madison steadfastly maintained that the jurisdiction of the federal government “is limited to certain enumerated objects” (Federalist No. 14). During Virginia’s Ratifying Convention, Madison argued that “the powers of the federal government are enumerated; it can only operate in certain cases; it has legislative powers on defined and limited objects, beyond which it cannot extend its jurisdiction” (June 6, 1788).  In other words, Madison believed that the meaning of the 10th Amendment was already implied in the enumeration of powers: “There cannot be a more positive and unequivocal declaration of the principle of the adoption—that every thing not granted is reserved. This is obviously and self-evidently the case, without the declaration.” However, other members of the ratifying conventions were less certain and insisted that the danger of an encroaching Congress was sufficient enough that the principle of limitation should not be left to implication. The 10th Amendment was added to the Constitution at the insistence of many states that wanted to ensure that Congress would exercise only those powers named in the Constitution.

These instrumental powers could not be foreseen and therefore could not be enumerated. As Madison explained in Federalist No. 44, the old Congress was forced to make a choice between two undesirable options. Either they could abide by the strict meaning of “expressly delegated” (in which case they were straitjacketed, as they lacked the powers necessary to carry into execution any of the delegated powers), or they were reduced to interpreting the Articles with great “latitude . . . recurring more or less to the doctrine of construction or implication.” Madison, and the Framers generally, had wanted to forestall the need for this kind of creative interpretative of the Constitution by  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_863","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_863","title":"expressly giving to Congress the power to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the enumerated powers.   Although the Necessary and Proper Clause filled a need that had become evident from their experiences under the Articles of Confederation, it nonetheless became a contentious issue during ratification. The Antifederalists in the Virginia ratifying debates frequently referred to it as the “sweeping clause.” Patrick Henry alleged that “the sweeping clause will fully enable [Congress] to do what they please” (June 16, 1788). And Tyler declared that “unless this clause were expunged, he would vote against the Constitution.” Madison and other Federalists responded that this clause gave no new powers that were not subsumed under the enumerated powers: “Should Congress attempt to extend it to any power not enumerated, it would not be warranted by the clause.” Yet Edmund Randolph, the more cautious Federalist, foresaw that there would indeed be difficulties with this clause. While disagreeing with the alarms voiced by the Antifederalists, he nonetheless denied that the interpretation of this clause would henceforward be as narrow as many of the Federalists were promising. Constitutions were not the same as laws; “a constitution embraces a number of things, . . . and their construction ought to be liberal” (June 17, 1788). Future debates would center on how “liberal” that construction ought to be.

Washington was torn over the constitutionality of this bill, and his two advisors, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, staked out opposing positions. Meanwhile, on the floor of the House, Congressman James Madison was vehemently opposed to the bank bill on constitutional grounds. He argued that the meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause must “be limited to means necessary to the end.” Quoting from the language used in the preamble of the bank bill, he mocked what they had substituted in place of a defense of the measure’s necessity and propriety: The bill was said to be “conducive to the successful conducting of the finances; or might be conceived to tend to give facility to the obtaining of loans.” “Conducive” and “facility,” he thought, did not meet the test of “necessary and proper.”  Madison moreover argued that his colleagues had not sufficiently grasped a distinction “between a power necessary and proper for the government or union, and a power necessary and proper for executing the enumerated powers.” The Constitution’s Necessary and Proper Clause only referred to the second instance. Even if the Constitution had failed to enumerate a power that was essential to the government, such as the treaty-making power, “the defect could only have been lamented, or supplied by an amendment of the constitution” (February 2, 1791).

Rather than be constrained by Madison’s limitation of a “means necessary to the end,” Hamilton believed it was sufficient to show that the means had “a natural relation” or that it had “an obvious relation to that end.” He argued “that neither the grammatical nor popular sense of the term” necessary required such a narrow construction. He championed instead “this sound maxim of construction; namely, that the powers contained in a constitution of government... ought to be construed liberally, in advancement of the public good.” Hamilton conceded that “the moment the literal meaning is departed from there is a chance of error and abuse,” but he felt that the demands of government warranted that risk (February 23, 1791).  Chief Justice John Marshall agreed that the word “necessary” admitted of more than one meaning. While its use could mean an absolute necessity “so strong that one thing . . . cannot exist without that other,” it might also mean “no more than that one thing is convenient, or useful, or essential to another” (McCulloch v. Maryland). He noted that when the Framers had elsewhere wanted to indicate the first meaning, they had used the phrase “absolutely necessary” (Article I, Section 10). He therefore gave greater latitude to the Necessary and Proper Clause than most democratic-republicans found acceptable. History has subsequently favored the approach of Hamilton and Marshall over that of Madison and Jefferson, but the controversy by no means ended when these luminaries passed from the scene.

Specific limitations on congressional power arguably serve to restrict the expansion of Congress’ power. These limitations are meant in some cases to protect liberty. Some of these limitations stop Congress from engaging in practices thought to be inappropriate for a representative legislature. Still others are constructed as limitations on how Congress can conduct business. However, all of these limitations place explicit restrictions on congressional action.

This limitation indicates that no money is to come from the treasury unless Congress has appropriated it through law. Given that money must be spent to run the government, this limitation requires that Congress act in a transparent manner before money may be spent.  One limitation on congressional power may appear quirky to the modern reader. The limitation on Congress’ ability to grant titles of nobility seems a fanciful limitation, but it is meant to promote the equal treatment of all citizens.

Many of the states at the Constitutional Convention had wanted to ban the slave trade immediately, but South Carolina and Georgia refused to agree to any Constitution that would not allow them at least a temporary right of importation.

They embraced his theory for how government was properly founded and acquired—the basic notion of a social contract. Hobbes is often remembered for his preference for monarchy, but in reality, his political philosophy was not limited to monarchy, contenting rather than sovereign authority, what ever form it took after the consent of the people, be absolute. The Constitution and its mode of ratification provided the embodiment of that consent in the United States.   Implicit in Hobbes' theory was the idea that the thoughts and idea of private individuals could not be reliably tempered by reason or reflection, but that governmental institutions, by the way they are constructed, can elevate the collective. This idea is given expression in Madison's Federalist 10—which explained how the private ideas of individuals or factions would be tempered through the way the Constitution was constructed.
