Deemed necessary because the Articles of Confederation were insufficient to govern the country, the Constitution created a new government with the power and flexibility to govern the United States of America, a new republic.  Though the Preamble to the Constitution makes clear that the federal government is of the people and is not imposed on the people by the states, the states were and remain an integral part of the constitutional structure. The Constitution was ratified by states, rather than the populace. Similarly, the Constitution is amended only if a supermajority of states agree to the amendment.  The Constitution is made up of several original articles and 27 amendments. Each of the original articles lays out a key facet of the structure, operation, and implementation of the the constitutional government.

On one hand, the Declaration proclaims that the states are not only independent of Great Britain, but independent of each other: “...these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States...” Indeed, many of the founding generation considered themselves primarily citizens of their states as opposed to Americans.

On the other hand, however, the Delcaration of Indendence in many respects presupposes an underlying unity that knits these states together more closely than other free and independent sovereignties. The Declaration opens by declaring that the states are acting as a corporate body: “The United States of America.” It also refers to the individuals composing the United States as one people: “When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another...” Do the individuals who compose other alliances (for instance, the members of the United Nations or even the European Union) consider themselves “one people”?  Finally, the Declaration closes with a mutual pledge that surpasses what one sovereign state would normally offer to another if it were forming a mere wartime alliance: “...we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_471","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_471","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_472","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_472","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide44848","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Declaration of Independence","thumbnail":"dr/Slide44848_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si44928","Text_Caption_681","Text_Caption_682","Text_Caption_683"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide44848"}}},{"id":"si44973","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si45022","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_214","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_214","title":"Background to the Constitution ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_680","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_680","roles":{}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_121","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_121","title":"Becoming a Nation ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_684","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_684","title":"Struggles to Maintain Unity ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_685","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_685","title":"At the time of the Declaration, then, in some intangible but real sense, the people of the American states were already thinking of themselves as one people.

VIII), and so Congress had to request money directed from the states. How each individual state raised those funds was up to the legislature in each state, meaning it was oftentimes not raised at all, or remitted to Congress long after it was due. As a result, Congress faced substantial revenue shortfalls, making it difficult to pay foreign debts, pay Revolutionary War pensions, and fulfill other basic functions of government.  Furthermore its powers of regulating commerce were extremely limited, which was especially irksome to the commercial states of New England.

The Articles specified that “Each State retains its sovereignty” (Art. II), which meant that the United States was, in all cases, beholden to its constituent parts. While the Articles of Confederation established a Congress, the Articles government had no executive or judicial branches. This meant that Congress could not enforce the powers it did possess or the laws it did manage to pass. The Articles did assert for Congress some authority over the states when they specified that “Every State shall abide by the determinations of the United States in Congress assembled” (Art. XIII), but they did not give to the federal government any means of making them abide should they refuse. A year before the Constitutional Convention met, George Washington wrote to John Jay about the need to address this defect above all others:  We have errors to correct. We have probably had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation. Experience has taught us, that men will not adopt & carry into execution, measures the best calculated for their own good weithout the intervention of a coercive power... To anticipate & prevent disastrous contigencies would be the part of wisdom & patriotism.

More importantly, Articles II and III of the new Constitution established an Executive and a Judiciary, respectively. The addition of these necessary powers meant that the United States was now a fully functioning government, competent to enforce those powers it was given. With these new powers, the government could govern individual citizens directly, rather than trying to govern the states as corporate bodies. As Madison argued in Federalist No. 20, “...a government over governments, a legislation for communities, as contradistinguished from individuals... is subversive of the order and ends of civil polity, by substituting VIOLENCE in place of LAW, or the destructive COERCION of the SWORD in place of the mild and salutary COERCION of the MAGISTRACY.” The Constitution established this magistracy, which was the only way it could make the determinations of Congress effective.

[or] appoint a commander in chief of the army or navy” (Art. IX). The requirement for supermajorities in so many cases meant that a small minority of people (sometimes one state) could successfully tie the hands of the rest of the states.  Even worse, the unanimity of all thirteen states was needed to amend the Articles themselves (Art. XIII). Thus the deep-seated flaws in the Articles of Confederation could not be fixed, even though most at the time understood and agreed on what those flaws were. Many attempts were made to amend the Articles of Confederation, though none were succesful. In 1781, for example, an amendment was proposed that would have given Congress the right to impose a 5% impost. It failed when only Rhode Island failed to offer its assent. Another attempt in 1783 that would have allowed Congress to impose a 5% tax based on the value of the imported goods and property (which its proponents viewed as inadequate, but nonetheless a step in the right direction), failed when Rhode Island agreed, but New York refused. It would ultimately take much more drastic measures than attempting to amend the Articles to supply the defects of American government.

The best known of these standards are in the second paragraph, where the equality of men, the consent of the governed, and the proper ends of government (the protection of the people’s rights) are declared. But added to these positive declarations—broad goals of government based upon the natural rights of men—were more narrow prescriptions for the proper structure of government and arrangement of political power. Looking at the Declaration’s recitation of the King’s abuses, which are spelled out in the second half of the document, a clearer picture emerges of what the American people regarded as the appropriate arrangement of three powers of government: executive, legislative, and judicial.

Before 1787, most governments followed unwritten, precedent-driven constitutions that might be supplanted by one or more documents. The British common law constitution is a good example of this kind of unwritten constitution of government.  All constitutions—whether written or unwritten—define who possesses the supreme sovereign power within government (whether king, parliament, or a democratic people). Whichever body wields that power, since it is supreme, can alter the framework of the constitution itself. Unwritten constitutions can therefore by very malleable (though they may well be very stable and remain faithful to tradition, as Britain’s constitution largely was). Having a written constitution establishes a legal form that is superior to all other laws, and that is superior to even those who make the laws.

The written state constitutions preceded the United States Constitution, and even the adoption of the Articles of Confederation. On May 10, 1776, the Continental Congress approved a resolution recommending that all of the colonies adopt new written constitutions. Between the years of 1776 to 1783, each of the thirteen former colonies would draft and approve its own state constitution; these would become the first written constitutions for free and independent states that the world had ever known. Abraham Lincoln would later contend that, since it was the dependent colonies that created the Union, and the Union’s actions created the independent states, the states therefore never had any legal status apart from the Union. (See his Message to Congress in Special Session, July 4, 1861.)  The status of the Constitution as fundmental law was reinforced by its method of ratification: it rested on the will of “We the People” rather than the dictates of any legislative body. Consequently, it is the Constitution—not anyone who wields power within the government—that is now considered supreme.

Charles would rule for 11 years without Parliament in a period known as the “11-year tyranny.” The House of Commons detailed the objections to Charles’ action in the Petition of Right—a declaration of established rights rather than new law. Charles only consented to the Petition when prominent judges clearly indicated that they would support his “emergency powers,” including arbitrary imprisonment.  Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.
