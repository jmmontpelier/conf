In doing so, the Constitution defines what issues are inside or outside the judiciary’s purview.

Indeed, the only real controversy was deciding whether federal courts—and especially “inferior” tribunals spread throughout the union—were really necessary to a government of limited powers like the one the delegates in Philadelphia were busy creating. Those delegates who wanted to keep the central government weak had accordingly argued that legal controversies should almost always be tried in state courts. The vast majority at the Convention, however, believed that the absence of a proper executive and judiciary in the Articles of Confederation was its primary defect. “An effective judiciary establishment,” insisted James Madison, “was essential. A government without a proper executive and judiciary would be the mere trunk of a body, without arms or legs to act or move” (June 5). Article III, which establishes the federal judicial power, is far more concise than those articles which establish the other two branches. The reasons for this brevity, both in the debates at the Convention and in the text of the Constitution, are twofold. First, judicial power was already generally understood and uncontroversial during this period—the colonists had largely adopted the legal traditions and precedents from Great Britain and their own colonial experience. Second, the judicial power was generally considered the weakest; it therefore was the least feared branch of government.

For instance, the Virginia Plan had ensured the trial by jury from the outset, and its necessity was never questioned by anyone. Dickinson used the jury trial as an example of the wisdom that could only be gained through experience: “It was not reason that discovered, or ever could have discovered, the odd, and, in the eyes of those who are governed by reason, the absurd mode of trial by jury. Accidents probably produced these discoveries, and experience has given a sanction to them” (August 13). Well before the United States Constitution was adopted, the sanctity of the jury trial had been enshrined in all of the state constitutions. The right to be tried by a jury of one’s peers was a development in legal theory which had proven so effectual at protecting individual rights that by 1787 no American dared question it.

Instead, Article III and the 11th Amendment of the Constitution define the circumstances under which judicial power may be exercised by the federal judiciary. For many commentators, this textual silence means that the power to decide disputes was already understood to mean a grant of authority.   The judicial power of the United States can be exercised when disputes arise that may not be fully addressed by state courts, or in which the federal courts have a particular need to be involved.

Similarly, the identity of the parties in a case or controversy can trigger the exercise of the judicial power of the United States. For example, “Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls” are within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  The “case or controversy” standard is a set of criteria that limits federal courts from being used to provide advisory opinions. This precedent was set early in our nation’s history when Chief Justice John Jay refused a request from President George Washington for advice regarding some legal issues relating to America’s neutrality in the midst of European conflicts. This has led to a complex tangle of case law that requires that a legitimate and serious dispute between two parties must exist before the federal courts can be involved.

Judicial review—the power to declare a law passed by Congress and signed by the president unconstitutional—was enshrined in constitutional doctrine by Chief Justice John Marshall largely through Marbury v. Madison.  The power that came to be known as \"judicial review\" refers to those court decisions that have the effect of invalidating legislation (whether passed by state or federal legislatures) on the basis that it violates the more fundamental law of the Constitution. British judges had occasionally struck down laws which they found inconsistent with the British Constitution, but the practice is even more closely tied to the American choice to write their constitutions down. Written constitutions have the effect, in a sense, of elevating the role of the judiciary power. In regimes with unwritten constitutions, legislators are generally their own judges with regard to the propriety of the laws that they pass. Judges, consequently, had very limited discretion when judging the propriety of the laws themselves, and political theorists had generally regarded the judicial branch as rather inconsequential. Locke had not even included the judiciary power as one of the three branches of government. And Hamilton noted in Federalist No. 78: “The celebrated Montesquieu, speaking of [the three departments of power], says: ‘Of the three powers above mentioned, the JUDICIARY is next to nothing.’” Those prior observations about the weakness of judiciaries was about to undergo an alteration as a result of America’s Constitution. A written constitution, if it is to be honored, requires judges to decide whether ordinary legislation has been passed in accordance with the Supreme Law. Hence, judicial review follows by logical necessity from written constitutions. Not all Americans immediately accepted this consequence, either from state constitutions or the United States Constitution, but this principle has generally been adopted in the intervening years.

A couple of outliers at the Constitutional Convention, John Mercer and John Dickinson, “disapproved of the doctrine, that the judges, as expositors of the Constitution, should have authority to declare a law void” (August 15). But the greater number of the Framers, including James Madison, simply assumed that the courts would have this power (see, for instance, Madison’s speech on July 17 and Mason’s speech on July 21). Hamilton in Federalist No. 78 explained that “a constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges as, a fundamental law.” Judges, therefore, “ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws rather than by those which are not fundamental.”  During Virginia’s ratifying debates, future Chief Justice John Marshall was already propounding what he considered to be the ineluctable conclusion of having a written constitution: “If [Congress] were to make a law not warranted by any of the powers enumerated, it would be considered by the judges as an infringement of the Constitution which they are to guard... They would declare it void.” He further asked, “... to what quarter will you look for protection from an infringement on the Constitution, if you will not give the power to the judiciary?” (June 20, 1788). Even the Antifederalists assumed that the judges would have this power, and criticized the Constitution on these grounds.

Madison (1803). There, John Marshall argued that the power of judicial review was a necessary consequence of two features of the Constitution: first that it was written; and second that it limited the powers of Congress (and, he could have added, it limited the powers of state legislatures as well). He argued:  The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is written.... Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and consequently the theory of every such government must be, that an act of the legislature repugnant to the constitution ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1002","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1002","title":"is void.... If an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts and oblige them to give it effect?... If then the courts are to regard the constitution; and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature; the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.  Marshall further asked the detractors of judicial review to consider what would be the consequences of denying this power to the courts: “It would be giving to the legislature a practical and real omnipotence with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within narrow limits.” And finally, he suggested that the wording of the Supremacy Clause implies this power: “in declaring what shall be the supreme law of the land, the constitution itself is first mentioned; and not the laws of the United States generally, but those only which shall be made in pursuance of the constitution, have that rank.”  Therefore, although judicial review cannot be found within the text of the Constitution, it is fair to say that the concept was a part of the “original intent” of the Framers and ratifiers, and also that it follows logically from what the document does say.

Neither of these proposals was adopted into the final draft of the Constitution, but discussions surrounding these failed proposals reinforce the presumption at the Convention that the courts would have the power to strike down laws they deemed unconstitutional.  For instance, when James Madison was discussing the necessity of a national veto power over state laws before they could be executed, he said that without such a power the states “will pass laws which will accomplish their injurious objects before they can be repealed by the general legislature, or set aside by the national tribunals [courts]. Confidence cannot be put in the state tribunals [courts] as guardians of the national authority and interests. In all the states, these [state courts] are more or less dependent on the legislatures.... In Rhode Island, the judges who refused to execute an unconstitutional law were displaced; and others substituted, by the legislature, who would be the willing instruments of the wicked and arbitrary plans of their masters” (July 17). Madison is here suggesting that all courts have a legitimate function of striking down unconstitutional laws, but some state courts had been afraid to exercise that power because of their dependence on state legislatures. Federal judges, therefore, because they would not be beholden to any legislature for their tenure, could exercise their power to strike down unconstitutional laws without fear of reprisals.

He would reply, that in this capacity they could impede in one case only the operation of laws. They could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law however unjust, oppressive, or pernicious, that did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity, as judges, to give it a free course” (July 21).

Wherever possible, they wished to elevate the judges above the noisy partisanship of the political process. Whereas a legislature should possess a comprehensive understanding of and sympathy with local interests, the judiciary should act with total objectivity toward those interests. The Constitution therefore prescribes that judges should be appointed by the two most stable elective offices, the president and the Senate; they should hold their office during good behavior (which is effectively a lifetime appointment); and their compensation should not be diminished during their tenure. If the Framers could succeed in creating a branch of government beholden to no authority but the law, then the judiciary could be trusted to uphold the rightful claims of a weak party when the legislative process might fail to do so. As Gouverneur Morris later argued in the Senate, without the federal court system, “the citizen is deprived of those rights for which he stipulated, or rather those rights verbally granted would be actually withheld; and that great security of our Union, that necessary guard of our tranquility, be completely paralyzed, if not destroyed” (January 14, 1802). The judge’s ability to defy the other branches of government and even an oppressive majority would therefore depend upon their independence.

There have been judges and justices who were not attorneys, though more recently they almost always have extensive legal training.

As one might expect, confirmation hearings have been somewhat contentious in recent years, and a number of nominees have been rejected by the Senate over the country’s history.  Lifetime appointment serves to insulate the justices from outside influence; however, presidents have occasionally sought to influence justices. Indeed, President Franklin Roosevelt’s “court packing plan” in 1937 was an attempt to influence the federal judiciary. Roosevelt proposed adding members to the Supreme Court, since the Constitution does not set the number of justices. The “court packing plan” was conceived to counter the influence of conservative justices who were hostile to New Deal legislation. The plan was met with broad resistance and was not adopted. However, President Roosevelt made his point, and soon after his “court packing plan” the Supreme Court began upholding New Deal legislation rather than striking it down.

On the other hand, they did not want judges who would act independently of the law itself. In all cases—not only in instances of judicial review—it would be inappropriate for judges to “substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature” (Federalist No. 78). The practical problem was (and remains): How can a constitution keep the judges immune from political pressures while at the same time keeping them beholden to “the constitutional intentions of the legislature”?

Treason and bribery are named, and the rest are included under the general terms of high crimes and misdemeanors—Errors in judgement, or want of capacity to discharge the duties of the office, can never be supposed to be included in these words, high crimes and misdemeanors. A man may mistake a case in giving judgment, or manifest that he is incompetent to the discharge of the duties of a judge, and yet give no evidence of corruption or want of integrity. To support the charge, it will be necessary to give in evidence some facts that will show, that the judges commited the error from wicked and corrupt motive.

He attempted to have Justice Samuel Chase removed, on grounds that he allowed political bias to interfere with his judgments. In 1804, the House successfully impeached Chase, but the Senate voted to acquit in 1805. This experience led an embittered Jefferson to write that the impeachment of judges “is scarcely a scarecrow”; it “is a bugbear which they fear not at all.” No other federal judge has since been impeached for any reason other than legal or ethical misconduct, and no other Supreme Court judge has since been impeached for any reason whatsoever.  Hamilton, however, had never relied on the impeachment power to solve the potential problem of judicial impropriety. He argued that the judiciary’s inherent weakness could be relied on to check its overreach:  The judiciary... has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society, and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments. (Federalist No. 78)  Therefore, Hamilton anticipated that the judicial branch “can never attack with success either of the other two”—at least it could not succeed without their implicit cooperation. In other words, the checks and balances of the three branches of government will only work if each branch possesses the will and the ability to resist incursions by the others.
