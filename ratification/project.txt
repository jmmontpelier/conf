Consequently, the Convention delegates constructed an entirely new system. Among the many differences between the Articles and the Constitution were the amendment and ratification procedures. The resolutions accompanying the proposed Constitution specified that ratifying conventions should be called in each state, and its delegates should be “chosen in each state by the people thereof.” Article VII of this new Constitution required only nine of thirteen states to ratify before it would become the new form of government for those ratifying states. Additionally, in Article V, the Constitution’s Amendment Clause only required three-fourths of the states’ approval. All of these features were significant departures from the previous requirement that only a unanimous agreement of the thirteen state legislatures could alter the Articles of Confederation. Many critics of the Constitution during the ratification debates maintained that these changes were unacceptable, since it meant that the sovereignty of the states was diminished.

When the proposed Constitution was submitted to the states, a quick succession of states—Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut—ratified within four months after the Convention had adjourned. The adoption of the Constitution seemed to be moving quickly, and the opposition, though formidable, was poorly organized. As the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention opened and progressed, however, the smooth process was derailed.  The contest there, as well as in Virginia (which ratified on June 25, 1788) and New York (which ratified on July 26, 1788), was bitterly fought and resulted in ratification only by the narrowest of margins. Though the Virginia delegates were unaware at the time of the June 25th vote, ratification had already been assured when New Hampshire—the ninth state—ratified the Constitution on June 21, 1788.  Later, in both North Carolina and Rhode Island, the process proved even more difficult. After two separate conventions in North Carolina the Constitution was ratified on November 21, 1789. Initially the Constitution was rejected in Rhode Island in a statewide referendum in 1788. It was eventually ratified on May 29, 1790, after the United States threatened to place tariffs on Rhode Island’s exports, and because it would be deemed a foreign nation under the Constitution.

Because the Articles of Confederation had been ratified by the state legislatures, Madison argued that it—just like any other simple contract—became nonbinding on the parties involved once any one of its members reneged on its obligations. He explained this principle at the Constitutional Convention:   If we consider the federal Union as analogous, not to the social compact among individual men, but to the convention among individual States, what is the doctrine resulting from these conventions? Clearly, according to the Expositors of the laws of Nations, that a breach of any one article, by any one party, leave all the other parties at liberty to consider the convention as dissolved....

Jersey herself; by which she expressly refused to comply with a constitutional requisition of Congs. and yielded no farther to the expostulations of their deputies, than barely to rescind her vote of refusal without passing any positive act of compliance. He did not wish to draw any rigid inferences from these observations. He thought it proper, however, that the true nature of the existing confederacy should be investigated... (James Madison, June 19)  Madison would return on several occasions at the Convention to this theme that the parties to the Articles had violated their agreements: “Besides the various omissions to perform the stipulated acts, from which no state was free, the legislature of that state had, by a pretty recent vote, positively refused to pass a law for complying with the requisitions of Congress” (June 30). Because the Articles were not a social compact, it was more fitting to regard them in the same light as any other contract or treaty. The Articles of Confederation therefore ceased to be a binding document as soon as any one of its members failed to comply with its terms.

The Constitution would be something entirely different than the old Articles—a lasting compact formed by individuals within a society. Whereas the states were left free to dissolve the Articles at any time they chose, the Constitution would be ratified in such a way as to make it a more permanent sort of compact. Because its foundations rested upon “We the People,” instead of being merely a “Union between the States,” the new Constitution could not be dissolved as easily as the old Articles.  The ratification of the Constitution therefore had to be different; its ratification would be founded on the true front of legitimate power: the consent of the individual people who made up the compact. But this method of ratification would do more than lend the new government heightened legitimacy and change the terms by which it could be dissolved. Madison provided another reason at the Constitutional Convention why the ratification of this compact had to be based on the people. It would alter the interpretation of subsequent legislation passed under the Constitution: “a law violating a treaty ratified by a preexisting law might be respected by the judges as a law, though an unwise or perfidious one. A law violating a constitution established by the people themselves would be considered by the judges as null and void” (July 23). Ratification by the people would therefore result in another important constitutional consequence. It would establish the Constitution as a fundamental law, one with the authority to nullify any subsequent law that contradicted it. It therefore formed the justification for judicial review.

The Constitution not only had to be ratified by the people, but by the people as they would represent the choice of the individual state in which they resided. Madison explained this blending of principles in Federalist No. 39:  It appears, on one hand, that the Constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the people of America, given by deputies elected for the special purpose; but, on the other, that this assent and ratification is to be given by the people, not as individuals composing one entire nation, but as composing the distinct and independent States to which they respectively belong. It is to be the assent and ratification of the several States, derived from the supreme authority in each State, the authority of the people themselves.  The deliberate consent of the people renders the United States a legitimate government. And governments based upon the consent of the people cannot be dissolved merely because one or more parts violate the terms of the compact. Still, the states were expected to retain an important function within this political compact.

Additionally, the states may, on application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states, request of Congress that a constitutional convention be held where amendments can be proposed.

But the nation as a whole and the states collectively—whether acting through the people or their governments—must both participate in the amendment process.  How the Constitution can and cannot be amended is fascinating, and the switch from a unanimity requirement under the Articles of Confederation to a supermajority requirement under the Constitution is telling. The change was clearly meant to make the amendment process less difficult than had been the case under the Articles.

As James Madison, writing as Publius, suggested in Federalist No. 39, the engagement of both levels of government kept the national and federal principles intact. Proposed amendments would be subject to ratification by the states. Congress, however, retains the power to determine how the amendments, whether proposed by Congress or through constitutional convention, are to be ratified. Amendments may be ratified through state legislatures or through state conventions, at Congress’ discretion.  Over 5,000 amendments have been introduced in Congress, but only 33 of these have succeeded in passing Congress to be formally proposed to the states for ratification. Of these 33 proposed amendments, 27 were ultimately ratified. 26 of these were ratified by state legislatures, and only one—the 21st Amendment, which repealed Prohibition—was ratified by the state convention method.

Still, some would have preferred a constitution that was even more responsive to the changing will of the people. Thomas Jefferson once asked in a letter to James Madison “whether one generation of men has a right to bind another” (September 6, 1789). His own opinion was that they did not. Later he came to the opinion that constitutions should be automatically reviewed and revised every nineteen or twenty years by a majority of the people. Although he admitted that he was “certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions,” the need to adapt to changing circumstances, and the right of the majority in every generation to decide for itself how it would be ruled, were considered by him to be of paramount importance (Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Kercheval, July 12, 1816).

Although he agreed that a constitution needed to be changeable—in order to rectify unforeseen defects or to adapt to new circumstances—he believed that these changes should be made infrequently and with more difficulty than mere majoritarian will. In republican forms of government, the greatest danger to individual liberties would always come from passionate and unjust majorities. Various obstacles therefore needed to be erected in order to check an unruly majority, and one of those checks was a stable constitution. In addition, every government depended on the “prejudices” of the people—their patriotism—for its support and maintenance. Frequent appeals to the people to reevaluate their constitution “would, in great measure, deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on everything, and without which perhaps the wisest and freest governments would not possess the requisite stability.” Madison believed that stable republican governments required more than that the “will” of the majority would predominate; rather, governments must be ruled by the people’s rationality: “... it is the reason, alone, of the public, that ought to control and regulate the government. The passions ought to be controlled and regulated by the government” (Federalist No. 49). A lengthy and difficult amendment process would promote the rule of reason over passion.  Both Jefferson and Madison recognized the need for stability, flexibility, and popular rule within constitutional governments, but they differed with regard to the ordering of these goals and the best means for achieving them. Madison, like Jefferson, had wished that amendments to the Constitution could be made more easily than their counterparts under the Articles. Yet he wished for an amendment process that was more difficult to navigate—and therefore more deliberative and less passionate—than what he feared Mr. Jefferson’s proposal would yield.
