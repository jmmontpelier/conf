It names some areas where the federal government is supreme over the states; it names some areas where the states have limited or no jurisdiction; and it specifies some actions or conditions that are forbidden to them and some that are required of them. But the Constitution for the most part does not dictate to the states how they must conduct their internal affairs. The Articles of Confederation made clear that the states were the constituent parts of the United States as a “league of friendship,” and that the states themselves remained sovereign actors. By contrast, the Constitution makes clear that the people collectively act as the sovereign. Of course, a number of state constitutions made the same point with respect to the sovereignty of the people of their respective states. But upon entering civil society, the people’s natural sovereignty is delegated to a civil authority.  Given that the people act through representatives—both at the state and the federal level—it may seem unclear where in this federal arrangement that sovereignty has been delegated. The uncertainty regarding the precise nature of sovereignty in general and the disagreements about the precise locus of sovereignty in this federal arrangement have precipitated some of the most contentious (and even bloody) disagreements in American history.

State legislatures and state governors continue to exercise the powers of their states, defined in the 10th Amendment as all “powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States.” However, the Supremacy Clause in Article VI called the continued primacy of the state as an independent actor into question.  The states did not give up all of their powers under the new Constitution. However, the powers granted to the federal government can impinge on the prerogatives of the state legislatures. Additionally, some specific legislative powers that the states had enjoyed under the Articles of Confederation were stripped under the 1787 Constitution. Over time, additional state legislative prerogatives have been implicitly or explicitly trimmed as the rights provided to individual citizens and to the people collectively have been expanded under the Constitution, and as the federal government has grown both in power and scope.

For example, because the power to regulate interstate commerce is vested in the federal government, less room exists for state legislatures to regulate in that area. Once an overlap is identified, the federal authority is generally considered supreme, but the notion of supremacy can become problematic. In an area where the federal government constitutionally acts, it is unquestionably supreme.

The Articles of Confederation already contained a supremacy clause of sorts: “Every State shall abide by the determinations of the United States in Congress assembled, on all questions which by this confederation are submitted to them. And the articles of this confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State” (Art. XIII). Therefore, in one sense, the Constitution makes no innovation when it declares that “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby.” The main difference between the old and new arrangements was that the Constitution empowered the new federal government to enforce the supremacy of its laws through powerful executive and judiciary branches. The mere assertion of supremacy without the means for enforcement is an empty threat.

For example, the Constitution prohibits states from coining money, issuing paper money, or retroactively interfering in contractual agreements. It is largely forgotten today that the irresponsible and sometimes corrupt policies of some of the states with regard to paper currency and contract laws were among the primary reasons some members of the Constitutional Convention believed a stronger central government was necessary.  Under the new Constitution, the states would be forbidden from issuing paper currency and “impairing the obligation of contracts” (Article I, Section 10). The legal meaning of the Contract Clause would later prove problematic, but the general intent of these provisions was clear. Madison, in his preparatory notes before the Constitutional Convention, had named among the various ways that the states had sought to violate contracts: depreciated paper emissions, making property legal tender, installment laws, and “occlusions of the courts of justice.” All of them except the last involved altering the requirements by which the original terms of a contract could be fulfilled; the last example amounted to blocking the possible means of legal redress for the parties who might be injured by any of the former measures. These violations, many believed, were not only unjust in themselves, but they undermined the mutual trust which was necessary for good government. Gouverneur Morris at one point in the Convention exclaimed, “Ask any man if he confides in Congress—if he confides in the state of Pennsylvania—if he will lend his money, or enter into contract? He will tell you, no. He sees no stability. He can repose no confidence” (July 2). The passage of the Contract and Tender Clauses was intended to foreclose on some of the greatest injustices that were then being committed by the states.

Allowing states to exercise this power was deemed inconsistent with the existence of a federal government created in part to bind the states together as a nation. When James Madison was listing the vices of the old confederation (vices which he hoped the new Constitution would remedy), chief among them were: A “want of concert in matters where common interest requires it” and the “injustice of the laws of the States” (”Vices of the Political System of the United States,” April 1787). The prohibitions on the state legislatures were meant to address both of these problems. Despite the fact that legislatures were limited with respect to some of the powers they were to exercise, the 1787 Constitution did require state legislatures to exercise power in specific instances. For example, state legislatures retain a role in the amendment process by ratifying amendments to the Constitution when three-fourths of the state legislatures agree. Additionally, state legislatures were tasked with choosing their state’s U.S. senators until the 17th Amendment required that senators be chosen directly by the people through elections.

For example, the 1st Amendment limits on the federal government also apply to state governments. The Constitution takes the same tack in limiting the prerogatives of states regarding voting rights. The amendments related to voting tend to be stated in negative language, noting that the right to vote is not to be abridged based on a particular characteristic. However, the effect of the amendments is to prescribe how states can grant the franchise.

Two examples illustrate this forced cooperation. Article IV of the 1787 Constitution prohibited the states from interfering with the return of fugitive slaves to their masters. When two slave states were involved, the requirement was a matter of cooperation. However, as states began to abolish slavery, the prohibition that free states could not protect runaway slaves from recapture by their masters became a matter of conscience for some. Nonetheless, until slavery was abolished, the forced cooperation remained in place over the objections of the abolitionists.  Article IV provides an additional mechanism for forced cooperation—the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A holdover from the Articles of Confederation, the Full Faith and Credit Clause guarantees that “the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings” of one state will be honored in all other states. The clause is an aid to interstate travel and guarantees that the official acts of one state will not be a dead letter in another state. For example, the Full Faith and Credit Clause guarantees that a court judgment from one state almost always will be enforceable in another state. That has two implications. The first is that one state may be required to allow access to its courts regarding a matter that did not occur in that state.

Under a system of federalism, in those areas in which the federal government can act, it is supreme. In all other areas, the state government or the individual is supreme. This division of supremacy is bound to lead to disagreements and tensions between the powers.  Federalism presents significant problems which include the shifting boundaries defining the areas in which Congress can or cannot act, as well as the potential for overlap in the separate areas of authority for the states and federal government. White the 10th Amendment is considered a key to federalism, it does not necessarily address this particular issue. The 10th Amendment merely states that the boundaries between state and federal power are to be decided according to the powers enumerated in the Constitution, but it does not prescribe how broadly or narrowly the enumerated powers should be interpreted.   The practical limitations of federalism can be seen in how education is regulated. Education is thought to be a matter of state and local control. However, the federal government has made clear that it is justified in affecting local education through its spending power and its power to regulate interstate commerce. Exactly where education and the spending power intersect, or how the spending power might yet be subject to containment, is unclear. That problem presents itself in many areas without a clear constitutional solution.

The 14th Amendment places limits on how states can structure their laws and treat their citizens. States cannot abridge the privileges and immunities of U.S. citizens; they must provide due process; and they must provide for the equal protection of the laws. These are structural limitations on state governments.

A federal government, on the other hand, would be a collection of sovereign and independent states which delegated limited powers to a central body through a treaty or alliance. The U.S. Constitution establishes a government that is neither national nor federal, according to their original meanings.

William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut admonished the proponents of a stronger central government that they were bound to show precisely how the states would “retain some portion of sovereignty at least” under their proposed plan (June 21).  The Constitution made clear that the states could not retain all of the sovereignty they had enjoyed under the Articles. George Washington explained to the Confederation Congress in a letter accompanying the proposed Constitution: “It is obviously impracticable, in the federal government of these states, to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all.” Almost everyone at the time, therefore, recognized that the states were relinquishing some sovereignty by adopting the new Constitution.

But not everyone was destined to agree with that formulation. And even among the proponents of divided sovereignty, locating precisely where that demarcation lay, and how it would be enforced, was in some respects left vague.

Though Congress was given the power to govern territory, territories were to be organized as states and added to the Union when they were ready. At the time the Constitution was adopted, the United States had a vast swath of western territory which was rapidly being settled. The country would continue to conquer and annex property until the current borders of the United States were established.  The Constitution provides few rules for adding states, though there was significant debate in the Constitutional Convention regarding the addition of states and the terms of such admission. The Constitution notes that states can be added to the Union and provides limitations on carving new states from old states and creating states from the junction of two states. The provisions were tested soon after the Constitution was adopted; areas that had previously been claimed by individual states subsequently became states in their own right.

The United States had to address the untamed Western Territory and had to address the claims of individual states that asserted ownership of swaths of territory that they barely governed and likely could not defend in any serious fashion. Given that the United States was not interested in acting as a colonial government for unorganized territory, there needed to be a process for governing the territory and adding states to the Union, since there was reason to believe that the borders of the United States might grow. The addition of states to the Union from territory that was acquired later—either through purchase or because the states had ceded their claims to the federal government—was all part of the westward expansion of the United States.   One exception to the general pattern of admitting states was the admission of West Virginia to statehood. West Virginia’s admission came in the midst of the Civil War, and it was created from land inside of the borders of Virginia, arguably without Virginia’s consent. The constitutional issues surrounding West Virginia’s admission is a balance between the federal government’s duty to preserve the Union at almost any cost and the possible violations of the Constitution’s prescriptions for admitting new states.  The question of the admission of states to the Union is not finished. The United States still has territories and still administers the District of Columbia. Whether territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam should become states is a question that touches on the old ideas that territories ought to be moving toward statehood and that Congress should not perpetually function as a legislature for territories.

The Constitution envisioned Congress exercising legislative power with respect to a federal district so that the district would not be located inside of the borders of any state. The Framers presumed that any state that provided the quarters for the federal government would have access to special favors, and even a state’s proximity to the seat of federal authority would likely result in preferential treatment. However, as the Constitution has expanded individual rights and has been amended to guarantee the equality of citizens, claims that the residents of the District of Columbia do not have political equality and calls for statehood have become more salient. It is also possible that old concerns that the national capital should not be within a state no longer seem as important to some people. Statehood for the District of Columbia would require a constitutional amendment. Whether that is a good idea or not is a matter for discussion.
