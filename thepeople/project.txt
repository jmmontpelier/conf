The Constitution functions through the people ceding authority or political power to the federal government in exchange for protection from outside threats and better security for their rights. Disagreements regarding how much power was ceded and how much power can be reclaimed when necessary or appropriate have been ongoing since the passage of the Constitution.  “The people” has two distinct meanings in the Constitution. The first meaning treats the people as a collective entity. When the Constitution’s Preamble states that this government is to be ordained and established by “We the People,” it refers to the collective judgment of the people in each state.  The second meaning treats people as individuals. When the 9th Amendment proclaims that an enumeration of rights is not meant “to deny or disparage others retained by the people,” it is primarily referring to individual rights. Deciding which meaning is to be given to any particular reference to the people can be tricky. For example, the 2nd Amendment’s reference to the people’s right to bear arms could designate the collective force of the state militias only, or it could refer to an individual right. Indeed, a recent Supreme Court decision ruled that the 2nd Amendment’s right to bear arms includes an individual right to self-defense.

The Constitution may well have not been interpreted any differently if the Preamble did not exist, but our constitutional discourse would be poorer if the Preamble had not been written.  The Preamble also provides a justification for the document’s creation.

Of course, the United States existed in some form under the Articles of Confederation. Though the Articles were supplanted, the United States was not.

This suggests that the new Constitution would rest upon a different foundation than the Articles of Confederation, which had only established a “Union between the States.” However, the language of “We the People” was hotly contested in the founding era. Many discussions revolved around whether the Constitution created a federal government that is still based on states as the locus of power or a national government that is based on the people as the locus of power. Madison had argued that there was some truth in both these views.  An additional problem stemming from the Preamble is whether it should be used as a lens through which the remainder of the Constitution should be interpreted. The Preamble is a part of the Constitution that was ratified and provides the reason for the document. This means that when the Constitution needs to be interpreted, the Preamble could be considered as a linguistic tiebreaker.  For example, if more than one legitimate interpretation of a constitutional clause is possible, one could ask which interpretation is more consistent with the Preamble in deciding what that text means. The Preamble could be thought to be as persuasive in determining original intent or original meaning as the Federalist papers or the debates at the Constitutional Convention. Nonetheless, historically the Supreme Court has tended to avoid using the Preamble as anything other than an unenforceable preface to the remainder of the Constitution.

The Articles of Confederation had a preamble of sorts, and the Constitution both adopted some of its purposes and added a few more. Both specified that the purpose of the union was the “common defence” and “general welfare” of its members. And whereas the Articles had promised “the security of their liberties,” the Constitution had promised to “secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” But the more noteworthy differences are even more illuminating than the similarities. Whereas the Articles had specified that the “States hereby severally enter into” the compact, the Constitution had opened with the words “We the People of the United States.” The Articles had called the union “a firm league of friendship with each other” (though elsewhere it called itself the “articles of Confederation and perpetual Union”).

The Constitution was therefore framed “in Order to form a more perfect Union.”  Finally, the new Constitution added two more goals that the Articles had omitted; the Constitution was meant to “insure domestic Tranquility” and “establish Justice.” The first is a clear reference to the domestic insurrections, such as Shays’ Rebellion, that the old Congress had been utterly incapable of addressing. The new government would be given additional powers to suppress such uprisings. The promise to “establish Justice” is less specific and more open-ended. It may refer to certain features in the new federal government, such as its new apportionment of representation. Many from the large states had thought that the equal representation that all states, no matter how small, had enjoyed under the Articles was “evidently unjust.” The new Constitution, they believed, went a long way toward correcting that injustice. It may also refer to certain prohibitions on state legislatures, such as issuing paper currency and impairing the obligation of contracts. The injustices of the state legislatures had rankled a number of the Framers, especially James Madison, and the new Constitution would now forbid the most egregious examples of these injustices.

A well-written preamble can serve the same educative function that James Madison ascribed to a properly constructed Bill of Rights: “the political truths declared in that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with the National sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion” (James Madison to Thomas Jefferson, October 17, 1788). There were still injustices, such as slavery, that needed to be corrected. And the Constitution offered the means, but not the fulfillment, of that promise. The prospect of self-improvement within the constitutional framework should remind us that a constitution transcends an ordinary law, and therefore some interpretations of the Constitution should transcend the merely juridical. While no part of the Preamble is enforceable within the courts, that does not mean that its content is empty of meaning. The Framers were here indicating their hopes that Americans would continue to strive for a “more perfect Union.” George Washington once wrote, “... perfection falls not to the share of mortals” (George Washington to John Jay, August 15, 1786). But individuals, like nations, can be more or less near to perfection. The Framers generally considered it everyone’s civic duty to move closer toward the nation’s ideals, and the Preamble names some of those ideals for which we continue to aspire.

However, that vision quickly faded and the Constitution was amended many times to protect and expand the rights of individuals and of the people collectively.  Rights come in two varieties—positive rights and negative rights. Positive rights are those things that a government must do for its people, and negative rights are those things that a government may not do to its people.

A list of enumerated rights, many believed, could impinge unintentionally on the rights of the people. A declaration that Congress could make new laws establishing a religion, for instance, implied that Congress would have had that power without the prohibition.

Notwithstanding the protections initially included in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights was adopted soon after the Constitution was ratified. Many subsequent constitutional amendments protect, specify, and expand the rights of the people collectively or individually.  The Constitution itself provides implicit protection for individual liberty through explicit limitations on congressional power. For example, the limits on the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus functionally requires that the government justify its detention of those who have been jailed. Similarly, the prohibition of ex post facto laws ensures that the government cannot criminalize an action that was lawful when it occurred. Those explicit limitations on governmental power reflect the Constitution’s calculus that liberty can be protected by constraining government power.  The Constitution’s carryover of the privileges and immunities clause (Article IV) from the Articles of Confederation was intended to increase liberty by guaranteeing that citizens can move freely from state to state without being treated poorly just because they are travelers or newcomers rather than citizens of the host state. The reiteration of that language in the 14th Amendment makes the import of the notion clear.

The first few amendments effectively provide rights by specifically limiting congressional power from abridging freedoms, such as the freedom of speech and religion. In addition, some of the Bill of Rights amendments protect specific rights, such as the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects (the 4th Amendment). Other amendments protect rights in specific circumstances, such as criminal defense rights under the 5th and 6th Amendments. The 9th and 10th Amendments more generally protect the rights of the people by explicitly noting that the enumeration of rights was not meant to be exhaustive and that federal powers are limited to the powers specifically given by the Constitution.  Other individual rights, such as voting rights, have been expanded by limiting states in the manner that they can restrict rights. For example, the 15th, 19th and 26th Amendments limit states from discriminating on the basis of race, sex, and age when defining the rights of suffrage. The 24th Amendment prohibits poll taxes.

James Monroe declared in the Virginia Ratifiying Convention that he was “a decided and warm friend to a bill of rights—the polar star and great support of American liberty” (June 10, 1788).

Virginia came very close to voting down the Constitution as a whole unless its suggested amendments were adopted first. Similar clamors for a bill of rights were taking place in the ratifying conventions of other states. Many of them attached an enumeration of recommended rights to their states for ratification. As a congressman in the first House of Representatives, James Madison sorted through and compiled these recommendations—rejecting some outright and altering others—in order to draft his own proposal for a bill of rights. In 1789, the first Congress crafted twelve proposed amendments from Madison’s initial proposal; they then submitted them to the states. The states then adopted ten of these amendments in 1791, which came to be known as the Bill of Rights. One more of these original twelve was adopted more than 200 years later, in 1992; it is the Constitution’s 27th Amendment.

The subject of slavery loomed large in the debates at the Constitutional Convention, and the Constitution would eventually have a huge impact on the future of slavery. But the Constitution of 1787 actually did very little to change the status of slavery in this country; the institution was still largely governed by individual state laws. There were two main exceptions to this general rule: one of these changes was an improvement over the status quo, but one made things worse.  The Constitution addressed the slave trade directly and the institution of slavery indirectly. Under Article I, Congress could not abolish the slave trade until 1808, but it could place a tax on imported slaves. Furthermore, Article V specified that the Constitution could not be amended to change this temporary protection of the slave trade. Under the Articles of Confederation, the power to import slaves had been entirely in the hands of each state. Many delegates had gone to the Constitutional Convention with a firm determination to put an immediate end to the importations. However, South Carolina and Georgia had refused to accept any plan of government that did not protect at least a temporary continuance of the trade. The year 1808 was the resulting compromise. In 1807, Congress passed a law that would abolish the slave trade beginning on January 1, 1808. Without the Constitution’s belated grant of power, the states of the Deep South, including the states that were subsequently adopted, could have continued importations indefinitely.

It is important to understand what the Three-Fifths Clause did not mean. It was never meant to suggest that slaves, much less African Americans as a race, were three-fifths of a person. The clause is not, strictly speaking, even about slavery. This clause is contained within the larger context of distributing representation and taxation among the several states.  When apportioning representation, the Framers considered three things: the equal sovereignty each state possessed upon entering the new union, the states’ unequal populations, and their unequal wealth. The first of these considerations predominated in the division of power in the Senate; the second two were factored into the apportionment of representation for the House. Therefore, the census was designed to quantify the   ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1122","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1122","title":"political importance of each state relative to the others, in terms of both population and wealth; it was never meant to provide a reckoning of individual personhood. Indeed, the three-fifths ratio had first been proposed many years earlier, as a way to distribute taxation among the states. Twelve states had agreed to that change, which shows that as a measure of wealth it was uncontroversial.  The reason why the Three-Fifths Clause was so offensive to many who opposed slavery was not because it “only” counted a slave as three-fifths of a person. Rather, it was offensive because it would mean that the southern slave-owners’ influence in the federal government would be augmented in direct proportion to (and on the basis of) their illegitimate dominion over slaves. Considering the practical effects of what a census does, the Constitution would not have been improved if slaves had been counted fully; instead, the offense against representative government would have been made worse. During the Convention, Gouverneur Morris offered the southern states a simple solution if they really wished for greater political leverage on account of their enslaved population: “make them citizens, and let them vote” (August 8). The northerners had wanted to exclude slaves altogether from the census, and the southerners had wanted slaves counted fully. The Three-Fifths Clause was a compromise between them.

Though that was an unalloyed benefit to the nation, it created a complication with respect to representation. Once the Three-Fifths Clause became inoperative, former slaves were to count as free persons for the purpose of apportioning the House of Representatives. The former Confederate states would gain additional congressional representation as a result.   The 14th Amendment further addressed the issue by making racial discrimination against former slaves with respect to voting rights subject to a loss of congressional representation. It went much further than many of the Founders would have thought possible. By making plain that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States” would be citizens, and by specifying that no person could be deprived of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” nor denied the “equal protection of the laws,” it granted full enjoyment of civil rights to all former slaves. The Privileges and Immunities Clause now applied to all citizens of the United States, and all Americans—whether their ancestry had originated in Europe or Africa—were now to be considered citizens.  The 15th Amendment ostensibly resolved the issue by barring racial discrimination with respect to voting altogether. In practice, however, that amendment was treated largely as a dead letter until the 1960s, as African Americans were systematically denied the right to vote across the south using a variety of means under discriminatory Jim Crow laws.

Furthermore, the original meaning of the amendment prohibited only state or local governments from discrimination based on race; it was silent on the question of whether private companies—such as railway operators, motels, and lunch counters—could enforce discriminatory practices.

He believed that the law should be used to correct defects in societal norms.  Subsequent court cases, especially since Brown v. Board of Education (1954), have held that “separate but equal” was an unconstitutional principle governing the distribution of public services; rather, “equal protection of the laws” mandated equal treatment. Some court decisions have even maintained that certain private businesses or transactions were barred from discriminating under the 14th Amendment, since the people who were prevented from engaging in those commercial transactions were in effect denied “equal protection of the laws.” Thus, the passage of the 14th Amendment did not immediately protect all of the civil rights of African Americans.

Other Montpelier slaves labored as skilled workers, trained in a variety of crafts including carpentry, smithing, and brick-making. Slaves oversaw the operation of a grist mill, sawmill, a whiskey and brandy distillery, and a blacksmith shop. The largest group of slaves at Montpelier was comprised of field slaves. These slaves worked the plantation fields, harvested tobacco, and oversaw livestock.  Archaeological investigations of the enslaved community have focused on three areas: (1) the South Yard for the enslaved domestic servants; (2) the “Log Home,” a part of the service and craft complex located on the south of the mansion yard; and (3) the Tobacco Barn and Field Quarter. The findings from the archaeological excavations can be accessed by clicking on the images to the right.  James Madison was himself deeply conflicted on the institution of slavery, with surviving letters and visitor accounts indicating that he would often talk at great length on the “evils” of the institution. Yet he never freed his slaves, feeling that whites and free blacks could not co-exist. As such, he was an early supporter of the American Colonization Society whose aim was to free slaves and see them returned to Africa.

Identified on a fire insurance map from 1837, the South Yard was comprised of three duplex-homes—or what are referred to as “Dwelling Houses for Servants”—and two smoke houses.  The South Kitchen, built in the mid-18th century is curiously absent, indicating that it was demolished sometime before 1837.  Archaeological investigations have been performed on the Southeast and Southwest Duplex-Homes, as well as preliminary investigations of the eastern smoke house.  These excavations revealed a series of stone and brick foundations on the two duplex-home structures that confirmed their size at 16 feet by 32 feet, or two rooms of 16 feet by 16 feet.  Each structure had a central chimney base, one of which was a classic Rumsford fireplace that provides definitive dating evidence for the South Yard structures—the only other Rumsford fireplace is seen in the wings of the mansion added in 1809-1812. Montpelier has used this evidence to recreate the timber frames of these structures in the South Yard today.  The archaeological excavations also revealed evidence for pipes that were used to transport water to an unknown structure, perhaps a dairy, beyond the South Yard, and of a roasting pit used for preparing barbeque.  Yet the excavations were not just about buildings, water pipes, or roasting pits, but the artifacts that would reveal more about the everyday lives of the enslaved domestic servants that lived and worked in the South Yard and the mansion.

The Stable Quarter lies just beyond the 19th-century formal yard and served as the home for an enslaved artisan household between the mid 1790s through to the 1830s when the structure was abandoned. Unlike the timber-framed structures of the South Yard (built in 1810) with their raised timber floors and central masonry chimney bases, the Stable Quarter was a log cabin with clay floors, at-grade hearths, and stick-and-mud chimneys.  While it might sound to be a much simpler, humbler arrangement than the buildings of the South Yard, in some ways it would have presented a more insulated living arrangement as the cold winter wind would not have whistled underfoot, and the clay-chinked walls would have offered more insulation than the thickness of a single plank of wood. In addition, the sub-floor storage pit found inside the structure would allow the household to store sweet potatoes through the winter—one option not available to inhabitants of structures in the South Yard.  The structure was originally 16 feet by 20 feet, consistent with other structures at Montpelier that have been identified as 18th century (smaller than those in the South Yard).  The archaeological evidence indicates that there were two rooms to the structure, each heated by its own hearth, and perhaps a single window.  Surrounding the Stable Quarter to the north were a number of borrow pits—originally used for the clay to chink the structure and the chimneys. These were subsequently backfilled with hearth ash and trash.

At present, three structures have been identified: (1) a three-bay tobacco barn that also served as short-term accommodation; and (2) two separate log homes.  Initially thought to be two or more separate log homes, the Tobacco Barn actually saw three separate types of activity within its three bays laid side-by-side. In its earliest phase of activity it was used as the name suggests: for the fire curing of tobacco that Madison would sell to factories first in Fredericksburg and then in Richmond. It was also used for short-term worker housing, as represented by the presence of domestic materials and food refuse. Finally, the structure was converted and re-framed to house a modern contrivance: a wheat-threshing machine similar to the one used by his close friend, Thomas Jefferson.  The two structures in the Field Quarter were identified by their sub-floor pits, or rectangular holes excavated into the floor of the structure for storage. Commonly located near fireplaces, these were often referred to as “sweet potato holes,” as warm, dry conditions favored the preservation of the sweet potato of the winter months. The sub-floor pit of both structures had clear evidence for re-use, indicating that the structures had been used over a long period of time.  Excavations also revealed that only the tip of the iceberg was uncovered, yet even the small quantity of features and artifacts have shed light on the experiences of the enslaved field laborers at James Madison’s Montpelier.

The presumed accuracy of historic documents is known to archaeologists as the “dictation of documents” and provides one reason why “ground truthing” (excavation) to assess the document’s accuracy is important.

The above image shows a colorized representation of a resistivity survey of the Stable Yard to the south of the mansion and South Yard service complex. The blue/purpole areas (Areas 3–6) seem to be oriented with respect to the 18th-century paling fence line, which is approximately at right angles to the garden (red box) and may represent work areas and yards associated with structures.
