The delegates to the Constitutional Convention decided that the American presidency would be administered by one person, and that person would wield considerable power. The president would be elected for four years (a long term by early American standards), and he could be reelected in perpetuity.   Under the Constitution the presidency was expected to be a powerful office, and so the Framers were naturally interested in finding ways to contain it. Nevertheless, it was impossible to limit that power by simply enumerating it (as was done with congressional power), since executive power, by its nature, is less susceptible of precise definition. Therefore, the greatest disagreements over the office at the Convention centered on how best to constrain the presidency to appropriate authority. The delegates gave significant attention to how the chief executive should be selected; the tenure in office; and whether the office should be occupied by a single person, divided among a number of people, or whether a single executive should be bound to the advice of a body of councilors. The most vexing of these debates was over the best mode of election for the president.

He or she must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and have been resident in the United States for at least 14 years prior to the election.   The age requirement is popularly understood as an attempt to ensure a candidate for president has the maturity and experience necessary to fulfill the duties of the office. The requirement that a president be a natural-born citizen is meant to ensure that the president is loyal to the United States, and the United States alone. Loyalty to the United States on the part of government officials was a priority of the framers, as Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7, also prevents any official of the United States from accepting a title of nobility from a foreign country. Finally, the 14-year residency requirement was instituted to reinforce the loyalty of the president to the United States, as well as to ensure that the president would be attuned to the current issues facing the country.  The 22nd Amendment places a further limitation on who may hold the office of president, by limiting a president only two full terms in office, or a total of no more than ten years should he or she assume office without being elected. Therefore, if any candidate would exceed either of these limitations, they are ineligible for election.

Far more important are the informal factors that are used when evaluating a candidate for the presidency, for choosing a president is the result of a lengthy and complex selection process. Whoever eventually becomes the president is often one from a number of acceptable candidates. In the nomination and election process, many questions arise as to the candidates’ character, experience, and a range of other issues. Most of these qualities are not requirements enumerated in the Constitution. Technically, then, these qualities would not legally disqualify someone for office.   While there are countless criteria used by voters, the media, and political parties which often change from election to election depending on the issues facing the country, there are a few worth focusing on. Often, a premium is placed on executive experience. As a result, the vice president and governors are often among the first considered for a party’s nomination.   Some presidential candidates are nominated directly from the Senate. These candidates are frequently strong in the area of foreign policy. Occasionally presidential candidates have been nominated from the House of Representatives, but this occurs with less and less frequency over time. Finally, presidential campaigns have frequently attempted to compensate in an area of perceived weakness by choosing a vice presidential candidate strong in that area.  Other factors as simple as a candidate’s speaking ability, family life, and personal background all also contribute to this set of informal qualifications for the office of president.

However, given how other federal officials are chosen, funneling the public’s choice for president through an Electoral College, whose members are chosen at the state level, is sensible. The intention was that voters would choose figures of local prominence, who would in turn have the knowledge and ability to choose a man of “national character.” Those electors then meet in their respective states to cast ballots for the president and the vice president.  The structure of the Electoral College ensures some degree of state control in the selection of the national executive. Each state selects as many electors as they have members of the House of Representatives and Senate; the voters in the District of Columbia choosing three electors. Most states require that all of its electors vote for the candidate who received the highest vote total in their state. Other states, like Maine and Nebraska, allocate their electors differently by basing the vote in individual congressional districts. If the Electoral College vote does not produce a majority vote winner, the House of Representatives votes for the president with each state having a single vote.

If we add together all the parts of the Constitution that specify how this office should be filled—Article II, Section 1, plus Amendments XII, XX, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, and XXV—we can see that more space and verbiage is devoted to this question than any other individual topic. The Electoral College will begin to make sense if we consider the different aims that the Farmers wanted for this office. They wanted a president who 1) possessed exceptional merit; 2) would be eligible for reelection; and 3) would be unable to corrupt whichever body was designated to select the next president while his predecessor was still in office.  The Framers considered almost every possible alternative of selecting the president: a choice directly by the people, by the state legislatures, by the states’ executive branches, by the Lower House of the federal government, by the Upper House, and by some combination of the above. They even considered a complicated process whereby a small group from the national legislature would be chosen by lot, and then, like a college of cardinals, the legislature would make their selection immediately before there could be any danger of outside influences. In each case they were dissatisfied, because they believed that at least one of their aims would have to be sacrificed.

Although almost all of the Framers believed ardently in popular forms of government, most of them did not want to see the choice of president placed directly in the hands the people. Some of them distrusted the people’s discernment of the best choice for this important office. George Mason, for instance, though he agreed with Madison that one branch of the legislature must be chosen directly by the people, did not trust the people to be proper judges of the best man for the presidency:  Col. Mason . . . conceived it would be as unnatural to refer the choice of a proper character for chief magistrate to the people, as it would to refer a trial of colors to a blind man. The extent of the country renders it impossible that the people can have the requisite capacity to judge of the respective pretensions of the candidates.  And many more were worried that presidential hopefuls would become demagogues if they had to court the people for the office—making extravagant promises that would win immediate support at the expense of the long-term good of the country. Charles Pinckney predicted that the people were sure to be “led by a few active and designing men,” and Hugh Williamson compared an election by the people to “an appointment by lot” (all speeches on July 17). Furthermore, the small states were concerned that their influence would be next to nothing in a popular election.

And because there was no opportunity for corruption, it would be safe to allow the president to serve consecutive terms in office. In addition, the Electoral College could be weighted in such a way as to account for both the federal and national principles embodied in the House and the Senate, and also account for the three-fifths rule established to account for slavery among the states. When, at the very end of the Constitutional Convention, the Electoral College was suggested, it seemed to be an answer to all of their concerns.  The subsequent experience of the way the Electoral College has worked in practice, however, is just one lesson in how the spirit of partisanship can overturn the most ingenious political solutions. Almost from the start, potential electors declared their prior allegiance to one candidate or another. This partisanship destroyed the possibility that the Electoral College would ever serve as the deliberative body it was envisioned to be. Still, the institution continues to serve the purpose of blending both federal and national principles into the selection of the president.

The 1787 Constitution did not restrict the number of terms a president could serve.

Consider, for example, the consequences if President Lincoln had not been eligible for a second term.  Currently, depending on whether an individual has served a partial term, a person may only serve two full terms as president. If a president has served fewer than two years of an unexpired term, two additional full terms may be served. If a president has served more than two years of an unexpired term, only one more term may be served.

However, the Framers had learned from many of the state constitutions written in 1776 which gave the state legislatures far too much power, resulting in an \"excess of democracy.\" They sought to correct this problem in the federal government, and therefore imbue the executive with greater means of checking the legislature.   Under the British Constitution, the King had exercised an absolute veto over the acts of Parliament. This prerogative gave the King a powerful shield which he could use to protect himself from encroachments by the legislative branch. Most Framers, however, were not willing to place so much untrammeled authority into the hands of the president. The Constitution therefore stipulates that a president may veto any legislation for any reason, but Congress may override that veto if it can muster two-thirds of its members in both Houses.

While the Constitution provides no punitive measures for a president who fails in his duty to uphold the Constitution, the Framers clearly intended that each branch of the government should, in its own way, defend the Constitution. When Andrew Jackson vetoed the Bank Bill in 1832, he recalled the duty of every public officer who swears an oath to the Constitution:  The Congress, the executive, and the court must each for itself be guided by its own opinion of the Constitution. Each public officer who takes an oath to support the Constitution swears that he will support it as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others. It is as much the duty of the House of Representatives, of the Senate, and of the president to decide upon the constitutionality of any bill or resolution which may be presented to them for passage or approval as it is of the supreme judges when it may be brought before them for judicial decision. The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges, and on that point the president is independent of both.

In addition, the president has the obligation to make suggestions to Congress about “such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” This duty could be construed as a way to invade Congress’ legislative powers.

A president may also resign, as Richard Nixon did in the wake of the Watergate scandal.  The House must impeach by majority vote and the Senate must convict by 2/3 vote. Those requirements suggest that impeachment and conviction will be solely used for serious offenses. Impeachment is to be used only in rare cases when the president has committed offenses that make the individual no longer fit for office, styled in the Constitution as “high crimes and misdemeanors.” The precise meaning of what constitutes such offenses is dependent on the House when impeaching and the Senate when convicting.

President Johnson’s impeachment involved a political matter that came to a head when Johnson removed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in 1868, in an apparent violation of the Tenure in Office Act. This Act limited the circumstances under which the president could remove officials whose jobs were subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. It can be said that President Johnson’s ultimate vindication proved that impeachment would not succeed when used on a political basis. President Clinton’s impeachment involved a personal matter that became a judicial matter when he gave false testimony under oath in a case prosecuted when he was in office. Though Johnson’s and Clinton’s cases were very different, they both had to be addressed under the general language of the impeachment clause.

Accordingly, the 20th Amendment provides Congress the ability to legislate the line of succession in the event that neither the president nor the vice president are able to serve. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 currently governs the line of succession. After the vice president, the next in the line of succession is the Speaker of the House, followed by the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then the secretaries of each cabinet department, in the order in which they were created, beginning with the Secretary of State.   The 25th Amendment addresses how to handle the temporary incapacity of a president, as well as the chief executive's impeachment, resignation or death, and specifically names the vice president as the first in the line of succession. Many presidents have had to relinquish their constitutional responsibilities temporarily. Most often this occurs when the president undergoes surgery or the like. The 25th Amendment stipulates that the president should communicate in writing to the president pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. He may then reclaim them when he regains the ability to act as president.

Morris expressed some suspicion for “those citizens of the world... he did not wish to see any of them in our public councils. He would not trust them.

To be incapable of being appointed is a circumstance grating and mortifying.” However, the greater number of delegates wanted to restrict the most powerful office in the United States, the presidency, to “a natural born Citizen” (Article II, Section 1). George Mason pointed out that were it not for the circumstance that many foreigners “had acquired great credit during the revolution,” he would be in favor of restricting even “the Senate to natives” (August 9).

And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.

Lincoln argues that, while it may be the sole province of the courts to decide individual cases, they yet may err regarding the constitutional principles upon which they base those decisions. It is the duty of every American—whether citizen, judge, congressman, or president—to understand to the best of his ability the authentic meaning of the Constitution, and to make political decisions based on that understanding. For the people to accept anything less would mean that they have abdicated their right to rule themselves. As James Madison said: “Do not separate text from historical background.
